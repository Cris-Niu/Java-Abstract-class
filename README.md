Hello ! This is my first essay ! I don't want to  write any programing skills essay, because today is a heavy day.
Yuan Longping, the word's greatest scientist has passed away yesterday. He was known for the developing the first hybrid rice varieties
int the 1970s and was hailed a national hero. He helped china with the hybrid rice to feed only one-fifth of the world's population with 
less than 9% of the world's land, which was his crowning achievement.
His pioneering research has helped transform china from food deficiency  to food security within three decades.
Finally, let us wish Yuan lao a good journey!
